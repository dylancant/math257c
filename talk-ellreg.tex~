\section{Elliptic differential operators}
\begin{defn}
  Let $E_{1},E_{2}$ be complex vector bundles over $Y$.
  
  A first order differential operator is a $\C$-linear map
  \begin{equation*}
    L:\Gamma(E_{1})\to \Gamma(E_{2})
  \end{equation*}
  with the property that for all $\C$-valued functions $f$
  \begin{equation*}
    [L,f]=L\circ f-f\circ L:\Gamma(E_{1})\to \Gamma(E_{2})
  \end{equation*}
  is given by a tensor, i.e.\ is induced by a section of $\Hom_{\C}(E_{1},E_{2})$.
\end{defn}
\begin{xca}
  Prove that first order differential operators are \textbf{local} in the sense that if $s\in \Gamma(E_{1})$ is supported in a closed set $K$, then $L(s)$ is also supported in $K$.
\end{xca}
\begin{example}
  A (linear) \textbf{connection} on $E\to Y$ is a first order differential operator $\nabla:E\to \Hom(TY,E)$ satisfying
  \begin{equation*}
    [\nabla,f]u=\d f\cross u.
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}
